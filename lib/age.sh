            But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
        That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
            Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
            Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
        On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
                         Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
