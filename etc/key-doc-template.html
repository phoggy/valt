        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>This document contains a “private key” that can unlock files encrypted with the associated
            public key. This document is intended as a backup and <strong>must</strong> be kept in a safe place. It contains
            instructions for using the (private) key to unlock a file — these instructions are a bit technical, so it includes
            some ways to get help if needed.</p>

        <p>Know that the key <em>itself</em> is locked, so it cannot be used without the passphrase used to create it. That
            passphrase might be written down below, or it might be stored somewhere else that you are expected to know.</p>

        <p>If you <em>don't have or can't get the passphrase</em>, stop here. Yes, really.</p>

        <p>If this all seems over the top, sorry... welcome to the modern world of digital security.</p>

        <p>Alright then, moving on…</p>

        <p>If you just generated this document, see <a href="#next-steps">Next Steps</a>.</p>

        <p>If you know your way around a terminal and need to decrypt an <code>.age</code> file, see <a href="#instructions">Instructions</a>.</p>

        <p>If all of this has you thinking <em>uh… what?</em>, see <a href="#getting-help">Getting Help</a>.</p>

        <p>If none of them are available, hopefully one of them can suggest someone else; if not, you'll have to find
            someone else…</p>

        <h2>The Key</h2>

        <p>This page contains the <em>encrypted</em> <code>age</code> public key pair, in two forms: as a QR code and as raw <code>pem</code> text.
            The text form is provided just for the unlikely case that the QR code does not work as it can be copied
            from the PDF or, worst case, typed in.</p>

        <p>To use the QR code, just open the camera app on your phone and point it at the image. You should see
            the same text as below (maybe just the beginning). Just copy it, send it to the computer on which you
            want to use the key and save it as a file with whatever name you like.</p>

        <pre><code>${_ARMORED_KEY}</code></pre>

        <p class="break-before"></p>

        <h2>The Prerequisites</h2>

        <p>The key is encrypted, so to use it you must know the passphrase. It may be written down
            <a href="#the-passphrase">here</a>.</p>

        <p>You also need a command line tool that performs <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/age.md">age file encryption</a>:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/str4d/rage">rage</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age">age</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The code used to create this document is a wrapper around <code>rage</code> and can also encrypt/decrypt files. The
            source code and instructions for it can be found <a href="todo">here</a>.</p>

        <p>There are other implementations to choose from <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age">here</a>.</p>
